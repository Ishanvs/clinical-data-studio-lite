# Clinical Data Studio Lite

AI-assisted clinical data review prototype inspired by Medidata Clinical Data Studio.

> This is a simplified prototype inspired by real-world clinical data platforms, focusing on governed data ingestion, quality monitoring, and AI-assisted workflows in regulated environments.

---

## 🧠 Overview
Clinical Data Studio Lite demonstrates how fragmented clinical datasets can be unified into a governed, real-time system for data review, validation, and AI-assisted workflows.

This project showcases:
- Product thinking for a clinical data platform
- Data quality monitoring and validation workflows
- UX for ingestion and discrepancy review
- Foundation for AI-native, compliance-aware systems

---

## 🌍 Market Context & Strategic Need

Clinical trials are becoming increasingly complex due to:
- Multi-vendor ecosystems
- Global regulatory requirements
- Increasing data volume and variability

At the same time, organizations are shifting toward:
- Real-time data visibility
- AI-assisted workflows
- Strong auditability and compliance

This creates a gap:

> Existing systems are optimized for storage and reporting — not real-time, governed, AI-ready workflows.

### Strategic Positioning
Clinical Data Studio is positioned as:
- System of record for clinical data quality
- Integration platform for partner ecosystems
- Foundation for responsible AI in regulated environments

---

## 🚨 Problem

Clinical trial data is often fragmented across sites, vendors, and systems.

This leads to:
- Manual reconciliation
- Delayed insights
- Data quality risks
- Lack of traceability

### Root Cause Analysis (People, Process, Technology)

- **People:** Teams optimized locally across disconnected tools
- **Process:** Manual reconciliation and inconsistent validation logic
- **Technology:** Custom ETLs, no canonical schema, no systemic lineage

This fragmentation prevented scalability and made AI unreliable.

---

## 🧠 Key Insight

**Trust is not a workflow problem — it is a system design problem.**

Without governed ingestion, standardized schemas, and lineage, downstream workflows and AI systems become unreliable.

---

## 👥 User Insights (JTBD)

Key user jobs identified through discovery:
- “Help me trust the data before making decisions”
- “Help me quickly identify and resolve discrepancies”
- “Help me prepare for audits without manual reconstruction”

### UX Implication
Shift from tool-based workflows to guided, system-driven workflows.

---

## ✅ Solution

A unified, governed platform that enables:
- Dataset ingestion and preview
- Automated quality checks and discrepancy detection
- Standardized data structures
- Foundation for AI-assisted reasoning on trusted data

---

## 🧪 MVP & Validation Strategy

### Hypotheses Tested
- AI can generate traceable, audit-ready outputs
- Standardized ingestion reduces integration complexity
- Early validation reduces downstream reconciliation effort

### MVP Scope
- Governed ingestion layer
- Canonical data model
- Basic discrepancy detection
- Initial AI-assisted validation

### Key Learnings
- Governance must precede AI scaling
- Standardization reduces onboarding effort significantly
- Explainability is critical for adoption in regulated environments

---

## 📈 Impact

### Operational
- Partner onboarding time ↓ 60%
- Integration defects ↓ 45%
- Data latency ↓ 80%
- Audit preparation time ↓ 50%

### AI + Workflow
- 50% faster discrepancy reviews
- 40% improvement in validation accuracy
- 100% traceable AI outputs

### Business
- Faster milestone billing → improved revenue realization
- Reduced cost-to-serve through automation
- Increased win-rate in regulated and enterprise deals
